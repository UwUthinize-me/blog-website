<h1>Is ProtonMail a honeypot?</h1>
<p>Protonmail is arguably one of the most private email providers and its privacy attracts many cybersecurity experts, hobbyists and researchers, myself included. On the surface protonmail claims to be a private end to end encryption with open source cryptography however there's reason to believe that protonmail may be a government honey pot or the more hopeful option is it was created by simply morons.
</p> <p>Protonmail claims a couple things including
   1 End to End encryption
    2 Zero access to user data
   3 Open source cryptography
   4 Swiss based
   5 Anonymous
    </p> <p>The appeal of proton is simple in their claims and even as someone foreign to tech you could see why its so popular however let's debunk some of their claims. 
    </p> <p>End to end encryption
        This claim is only supported under sending and receiving emails through proton, using any other email provider is required to go through port 25 which is unable to be encrypted in any form meaning everything sent from a proton email to a gmail email (and vice versa) is all in plaintext like youre reading now. In the claim on protons website its not explicitly said that end to end encryption is only available through proton users so that may be your argument on why they are right and i'm not
        </p> <p>Zero access to user data
            As a follow up to protons end to end encryption claim it also claims that all encryption is client side meaning they do not have the encryption key, this was also proved to be false and that proton can decrypt messages as they see fit at any time. Email wasn't created to be private thus there will be logs at one point or another and giving proton user data that at one point or another will be stored.
            </p> <p>Open source cryptography
                To be quite honest I can't argue that however someone with more experience than me could give you a good reasoning within the contents of their source code.
                </p> <p>Swiss based
                    Again I can't argue with where its based because the server placement is a proven thing however the controversial thing is that proton does have government ties and swiss privacy laws aren't as unbelievably good as large companies make them out to be. Protonmail is partially owned by the CRV and Swiss government before selling equity ownership to the CRV and FONGIT and at the time the equity sale and CRV founder Ted Ditersmith was working with the CIA and NSA for a “In-Q-Tel” project.

                        Discussing a reason to debunk that proton is not anonymous is a topic of ethical and moral debate. Ethically protonmail cannot be anonymous (meaning its protected by Tor in this case) because of the spam emails and phishing links that can spawn from bots once proton goes anonymous otherwise it can be put on block list and essentially die out extremely quickly, however morally proton should be anonymous because its marketed as an anonymous browser and gets its success from claiming to be anonymous. 
                        </p> <p>Conclusion
                            you must remember nothing about email is inherently anonymous because it was not designed to be anonymous so your best option is to not use email at all. An honorable mention and something you can compare Protonmail to is Cock.li  because its very similar to proton in terms of features but its more of a joke more than anything.
