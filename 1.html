<h1>Why landlines should make a comeback</h1>
<p>
    1950-1970 was the peak usage of landlines; however they still remained a valid option up until the early 2000s when they were replaced with mobile cellular phones. Currently (2021) data service providers make a large amount of their money through selling data plans,The current average phone plan for a family of 4 is currently over $100 monthly. While landlines are between $20-$40 monthly.  aren't gone, they are few and far between, But here's my stance on why they should come back.
    </p> <p>
    A landline for the average person isn't exactly practical, most people are willing to pay the extra for the many conveniences and needs a mobile phone can provide however, paying the extra fee each month for a landline doesn't seem as bad as an idea as it may seem. A landline provides a more safe and secure way to answer your phone calls and its vulnerabilities are lowered significantly, I urge you to think of an important call or meeting you've had where you are risked with your phone being hacked, listened in on or just your phone dying, none of those problems are relevant with a landline thus providing a more reliable experience. A landline is also a good idea to have around if you have children. Teaching your children how to use a phone incase of emergencies is a crucial step in guaranteeing your kids safety when you may not be present is an important step in the right direction. </p> <p>
    
    Out of the 4 people I interviewed the common consensus was that a landline also gives both parties a little bit of anonymity, without caller ID or the ability to view the phone number before answering you’re given a lot of unknowns however the 4 people I interviewed agreed that there are ways to prevent it “I never speak first, i'll wait 15 seconds and if someone doesn't speak ill hang up” said on user. Another user claimed to wait 5 seconds and then ask for their name. Another not so impactful flaw is that the majority of the time the phone number attached to your landline can be in the phone book as a business that is no longer in business or attached to an old google maps listing. I spoke with one user whose number attached to his landline was from a closed down Dennys.</p> 
    
    Landlines may have some very good benefits for the average business worker or someone that doesn't need much internet access however however relying on a landline may be a mistake, they have amazing everyday use reliability but storms and power outages may leave you in a bad situation, you’re also unable to take it with you unlike a mobile phone that provides the convenience of leaving your wall. However, with their disadvantages, having a landline as an extra source for anonymity and reliability is worth the extra couple of dollars each month.
